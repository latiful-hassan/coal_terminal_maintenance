**Context**:
  - Assessing which Coal Reclaimer machines require maintenance in the upcoming month. The machines run 24/7/365 and a minute of downtime equates to millions of dollars in lost revenue.

**Criterion**:

  - **Idle Capacity** is a utlisation metric which is definied as:
    * Idle Capacity = (Actual Tonnage - Nominal Capacity)/Nominal Capacity
 
**Task**:
