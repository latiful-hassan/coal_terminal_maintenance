**Context**:
  - assessing which Coal Reclaimer machines require maintenance in the upcoming month
  - the machines run 24/7/365 and a minute of downtime equates to millions of dollars in lost revenue

**Criterion**:
  - a reclaimer machine requires maintenances when withing the previous month there was at least one 8-hour period when the average idle capacity was ver 10%
  - **Idle Capacity** is a utlisation metric which is definied as:

**Task**: 
- find out which of the 5 machines have exceeded this level and create a report for the executive stakeholders with your recommendations

**Techniques & Process**:
- a dummy column named 'Timeline' is created in Excel on a new sheet where we recreate the 'Datetime' column from the earliest date in the source data and increment by 1 hour
- the Timeline column is then used as a master to connect the rest of the data with left-joins
- after creating the joins in Tableau, the data was further cleaned by hiding the vestigial Datetime columns
- all rows with values were then pivoted
- below you can see the joins as well as the pivoted data that has been renamed:

- to find the Idle Capacity, I created a graph shoing machines against hours and added a **Table Calculation** of **Difference** computed with **Table Down**. This calculates the Actual Tonnage - Nominal Capacity:
